# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017
Started War Card game application. Setting up the repository with create-react-app. Refreshing React knowledge.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017
Learned how to shuffle a deck of card, added some blocks to my application.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017
Tired. Didn't do much. Added a Card component and added the catalog of cards needed to play the game.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017
Managed to code for an hour I think. I can see the cards that are picked. Need to make the whole process automated and make players win cards.
